# D2 Brief

Delivered by two written reports (Design and Test Reports) software, and presentation.

- **Design Manual**: should include top-level design and sufficient documentation to allow modification and reuse by another group of students.
- **Test Report**: should contain sufficient evidence of unit testing and system validation for likely use cases.
- **Presentation**: a seminar style presentation of the project and a demonstration of the tool that you have developed. The seminar and demo should not last more than 30-minutes, excluding questions.

The date and time of the seminar is to be arranged. The seminar is expected to take place shortly after delivery of D2 reports and software. 

The marks for D2 will be distributed after receiving the 2 reports, presentation and software, but are expected to be 15% for each report and 20% for the demo and presentation.
