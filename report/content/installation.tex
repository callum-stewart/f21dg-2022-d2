\section{Installation}

Installation of the whole system only requires a preexisting version of Node (version 16 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager).

Note: We only use Node to aid the deployment speed and to use Webpack, and Node does {\it not} act as a backend for our system. Files are served to the browser with no further communication taking place after receiving.

The following commands are then executed from the root project directory once the project code is cloned into the correct directory:

To install required node packages:

\verb|npm install|

To build the project statically in \verb|dist|:

\verb|npm run build|

To run a lightweight server that hosts the content on port 8080:

\verb|npm start|
