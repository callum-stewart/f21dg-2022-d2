\begin{enumerate}
\item Browser not supported: Our application has been tested using Chromium Browsers, specifically Chrome v87 \& v99. Incompatibilities were experienced with Firefox (specifically Firefox 78.15.0esr) and Safari (all versions), hence those browsers are not recommended for use. 
\item File not supported: Only .csv/.CSV files are supported. We recommend that you follow the format specified in the FileIO Section.
